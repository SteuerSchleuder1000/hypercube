In geometry, a hypercube is an n-dimensional analogue of a square (n = 2) and a cube (n = 3). It is a closed, compact, convex figure whose 1-skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space's dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length.

This app visualizes a 3d slice of the cube using the threejs library

You can rotate the cube around its x, y, z and u axis or throw it and see on what site it lands.
